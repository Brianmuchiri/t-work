<p>My spirit animal.</p>

<p><img src="/home/brian/Documents/jhdjh/download.jpg" alt="Tiger"
style="width:450px;height:450px;margin-left:15px;">
I like the tiger because it walks alone and it has a powerful presence which
cannot be ignored .Its more of an introvert because it doesnt seek attention
like the lion ,which is supposedly known as the king of lion.The tiger to me is
a bigger better lion which doesnt need to be called the king of the jungle as it
has all the attention it needs from itself.</p>
